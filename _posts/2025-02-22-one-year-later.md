### One year later   

It's been a year since I started using Pikapods, and I've been really happy with the service. It has been stable, hassle-free and cheap. And what else can you ask from a SaaS provider these days?
Then again, I have not used the service in any meaningful form for a year, and paying for a service that I don't use, with clear and free alternatives, made the decision for me to just have to get with the program and learn how to use Jekyll.
Ghost is a great platform that still seems to struggle with the concept of multifactor authentication (MFA), and I use it for running my newsletter ([perspektivet.news](https://perspektivet.news/)), but if you only manage to publish a single post a year, then you don't need to pay for a service.    

### Jekyll   

I have tested GitHub Pages and Jekyll a few times before. It can be complicated if you don't have any experience. However, I had something I did not have back then: Claude AI.
For the last month, I have been testing Claude as my daily AI/LLM service, and it helped me navigate the setup and inevitable errors that showed up. This is something they do very well. Add VSCode and Dev containers to the mix and I was able to establish a site, move the old content, and have everything work in a few hours (less if I had not been recovering from the flu).
