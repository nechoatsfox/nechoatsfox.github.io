### echo $USER   

My name is Nelson. I am a father and IT security professional.  
I have worked in the IT security field for the past eleven years, holding several different roles. For the last three years, I have been a consultant.  
At home, my world revolves around my sometimes delightful two-year-old, who brings endless joy and a lively atmosphere (along with some hearing damage).  

This are some projects I have done:

  - [Kryptisk cybersikkerhet](https://kryptisk.substack.com/) - A Norwegian newsletter about cybersecurity (**not active**)
  - [Norsec](https://norsec.dev) - A discord server for people interested in cybersecurity
  - [Perspektivet](https://(perspektivet.news) - A monthly newsletter about cybersecurity (in Norwegian)
