Home networking today is something you don't think about; it just works. You likely have a router from your ISP and connect to it by wifi. This type of connectivity is something we as users no longer think about. The more technically inclined of you might use ethernet. Still, most of the time, it also just works. In the before times, it was not always the case.   


About 25 years ago, I attempted to build a home network using 10BASE2 equipment.
If you are unfamiliar with 10BASE2, you are probably not alone. It's a predecessor to the current form of ethernet; it used a coax cable and supported up to 10Mbit/s. The segments had to be terminated with a resistor, or you had to make a loop.
I can't remember why I tried it, but I remember having a network card on my computer. So I thought it was a good idea to use it and build a home network.

I was rocking a Pentium II and a hard disk drive with at least a few hundred megabytes.
I remember having a network card and buying the cable at the local electronics store (it's still there); I never got it to work since I knew very little about networking or network protocols. So I connected the two computers and just tried settings in Windows.


There was no Google where I could search for answers. None of my friends had home networks or the Internet. Most did not even have a dial-up connection. Compared to today, it was the digital dark ages.
There is a whole discussion about productivity then versus now and the amount of readily available content and knowledge we have today, but I won't get into it now.
I don't remember what happened with all that equipment; I moved not long after, and I have to assume I got rid of it then.
But I do remember trying and failing to get a network going; it was not the first time I remember failing at something, and it was not the last time.
